We're six months in! I still live, and while I feel a lot more tired, I kind of feel fine. <!--more-->
Not gonna lie, I thought this getting-a-kid-business would be worse. We're blessed with a happy bundle of joy now, and seeing her discover the world and learning new skills is more fun than any show on TV.  
As is obvious, I was completely wrong when I told people becoming a dad wouldn't change me, but I wouldn't want it any other way..
