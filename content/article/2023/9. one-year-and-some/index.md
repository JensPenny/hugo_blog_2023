There is something magical in seeing a new life learn, laugh and love new things every day. <!--more-->
Our girl is still the happiest small kid I could have wished for, and this more than makes up for the horrible first 6 months we had to endure.
She loves going to the daycare, she loves it when we come to pick her up and she can stumble, fall, cry and get up to her hearts content.
We're in heavy construction work at this moment and it's pretty stressful, but she'll be the one to get us through I think.  
Let's just hope it stays that way, at least also when she gets to 2 years old. She has a sister on the way, and for our sake as well I hope that she'll
get into the big-sister role as easily as she got in the 'great toddler' role.
